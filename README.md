# Auction System

## Auction system consisting of Client, Manager and Repository
Currently, there isn't much to do with the aplications. This file will be updated with instructions in how to run each module when the time is right.

### Repository:
Currently, the repository module is under development in the BlockchainedRepository module, where a blockchain was implemented.
This includes a Hashing class, which uses SHA256 to hash a given string, the Block class, with its constructor, and method to hash its contents. There is also a method in the Main class of this module, which validates the blockchain. Further instructions can be obtained by reading the comments inside each source file, since documentation for this project is not a priority.
